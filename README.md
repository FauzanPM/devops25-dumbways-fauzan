> Here, I am using a service provider from AWS and Terraform to create a server using IaC. Here, I am only creating main. tf file for the server creation center and security_group.tf to open ports.

> In the program above, I use the Sydney region, specify the AMI (operating system used according to the region), specify the instance used (t3.small), specify the SSH key used, add a name tag for convenience, then call the security group that has been created, and add an output after finishing creating the VPS so that I don't need to return to the AWS console.
